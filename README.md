# install-scripts

This is a collection of scripts to complement my other air-traffic related repositories, some of them are quite fundamental, some are optional

## rtl-sdr

This is the most fundamental one which is the basis for all other SDR based applications

## dump1090-fa

This is the basis for the most popular ADS-B feeders like SkyAware, PlaneFinder, FlightRadar24

## kalibrate-sdr

This is a tool to aquire the appropriate ppm setting for the SDRs

## piaware

This is a full setup suite that besides piaware installs dump1090, fa-mlat-client, faup1090, dump978

## PlaneFinder

This is one of the popular ADS-B Feeders which is particularly interesting as it also receives traffic from the OGN network
