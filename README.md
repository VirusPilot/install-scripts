# install-scripts

This is a collection of scripts to complement my other air-traffic related repositories, some of them are quite fundamental, some are optional

## rtl-sdr (https://github.com/osmocom/rtl-sdr)

This is the most fundamental one which is the basis for all other SDR based applications

## dump1090-fa (https://github.com/flightaware/dump1090)

This is the basis for the most popular ADS-B feeders like SkyAware, PlaneFinder, FlightRadar24

## kalibrate-sdr (https://github.com/steve-m/kalibrate-rtl)

This is a tool to aquire the appropriate ppm setting for the SDRs

## piaware (https://flightaware.com/adsb/piaware/install)

This is a full setup suite that besides piaware installs dump1090, fa-mlat-client, faup1090, dump978

## PlaneFinder (https://forum.planefinder.net/threads/raspberry-pi-b-zero-rpi2-rpi3-rpi4-installation-instructions-for-raspbian-dump1090-data-feeder.241/)

This is one of the popular ADS-B Feeders which is particularly interesting as it also receives traffic from the OGN network
